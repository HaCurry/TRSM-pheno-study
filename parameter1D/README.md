## calculating scripts

`oneD_param1D_createGrid_configure.py`: creates the grid points for each BP as seen
in the thesis. The grid points are saved as `.tsv` files in the directory grids.

`oneD_param1D_configure.py`: creates the directory structure, the input files for `ScannerS`
and the condor submit file and executable for the 1 dimensional parameter variatio on each
of the grid points created by `oneD_param1D_createGrid_configure.py`

## plotting scripts

`oneD_param1D_createGrid_plot.py`: plots the grid points for each BP (just which
mass points not the 1 dimensional plots). Plots can be found in the directory plots.

`oneD_param1D_plot.py`: plots the 1 dimensional parameter variation for each grid point
using the `ScannerS` calculations done by the condor (where the condor jobs were created
by using the submit file and executable generated by `oneD_param1D_configure.py`)
